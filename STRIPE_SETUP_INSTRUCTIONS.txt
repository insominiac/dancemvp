# Stripe Setup Instructions

## To fix the Stripe payment error, you need to:

1. Create a Stripe account at https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. Get your test API keys from the Stripe dashboard
3. Update your .env file with the actual keys

## Environment Variables Needed:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_[your_publishable_key_here]
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_[your_secret_key_here]
```

## Important:
- Use test keys for development (they start with pk_test_ and sk_test_)
- Never commit actual keys to version control
- Use production keys only in production environment
