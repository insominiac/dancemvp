# Classes Showing as "Full" - Issue Fixed

## 🔧 **Problem Identified and Resolved**

**Issue**: All classes were showing as "Class full" even when they had 0 bookings and available capacity.

**Date Fixed**: September 22, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Problems Found:

1. **Field Name Mismatches**: The frontend was expecting different field names than what the API was returning
2. **Wrong Status Check**: Frontend was checking `classData.status === 'ACTIVE'` but should check `classData.isActive`
3. **Interface Mismatch**: TypeScript interface didn't match actual API response structure

### Issues in Detail:

| Frontend Expected | API Returns | Issue |
|------------------|-------------|-------|
| `maxStudents` | `maxCapacity` | Wrong field name |
| `duration` | `durationMins` | Wrong field name |
| `schedule` | `scheduleDays` + `scheduleTime` | Missing fields |
| `status === 'ACTIVE'` | `isActive: true` | Wrong property check |
| `venue.address` | `venue.addressLine1` | Wrong field name |

## 🛠️ Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Interface Definition
Updated `ClassDetail` interface to match API response:

```typescript
interface ClassDetail {
  // Fixed field names to match API
  durationMins: number        // was: duration
  maxCapacity: number         // was: maxStudents
  scheduleDays: string        // was: schedule (partial)
  scheduleTime: string        // new field
  isActive: boolean          // added for proper checking
  venue?: {
    addressLine1: string     // was: address
    // ... other fields
  }
}
```

### 2. Fixed Availability Logic
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
const spotsLeft = classData.maxStudents - classData.currentStudents
const isAvailable = spotsLeft > 0 && classData.status === 'ACTIVE'

// After (WORKING):
const spotsLeft = classData.maxCapacity - classData.currentStudents  
const isAvailable = spotsLeft > 0 && classData.isActive
```

### 3. Updated Field References
Fixed all references throughout the component:
- `classData.maxStudents` → `classData.maxCapacity`
- `classData.duration` → `classData.durationMins`
- `classData.schedule` → `classData.scheduleDays` + `classData.scheduleTime`
- `classData.venue.address` → `classData.venue.addressLine1`

## ✅ Verification

### API Response Confirmed:
```json
{
  "maxCapacity": 20,
  "currentStudents": 0,
  "isActive": true,
  "durationMins": 60,
  "scheduleDays": "Monday",
  "scheduleTime": "5:00 PM"
}
```

### Calculation Results:
- **Spots Left**: `20 - 0 = 20 spots available`
- **Is Available**: `20 > 0 && true = true`
- **Display**: "20 left" instead of "Class full"

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Broken):
```
Available spots: Class full
Class size: undefined students max
Currently enrolled: 0 students
[Book Class] Button: DISABLED
```

### After (Fixed):
```
Available spots: 20 left  
Class size: 20 students max
Currently enrolled: 0 students  
[Book Class] Button: ENABLED
```

## 🎯 Classes Now Available

All classes should now show correct availability:

| Class Name | Capacity | Enrolled | Available |
|------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Test Admin Class | 20 | 0 | **20 left** |
| Hip Hop Fundamentals | 30 | 0 | **30 left** |
| Ballet Excellence | 20 | 0 | **20 left** |
| Contemporary Flow | 25 | 0 | **25 left** |
| Salsa Social | 40 | 0 | **40 left** |
| Test Dance Class | 20 | 0 | **20 left** |
