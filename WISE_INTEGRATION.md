## üì± Frontend Integration

### Using the Payment Provider Selector

```tsx
import PaymentProviderSelector from '@/app/components/payments/PaymentProviderSelector'

function CheckoutForm() {
  const [paymentProvider, setPaymentProvider] = useState<'STRIPE' | 'WISE'>('STRIPE')

  return (
    <PaymentProviderSelector
      selectedProvider={paymentProvider}
      onProviderChange={setPaymentProvider}
    />
  )
}
```

### Creating a Payment Session

```typescript
// Example API call to create payment session
const response = await fetch('/api/payments/create-session', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    paymentProvider: 'WISE', // or 'STRIPE'
    bookingType: 'class',
    itemId: 'class-id',
    userId: 'user-id',
    customAmount: 100.00,
    // Wise-specific fields
    wiseRecipientDetails: {
      name: 'Recipient Name',
      email: 'recipient@example.com',
      currency: 'USD',
      type: 'EMAIL'
    }
  })
})
```

## üîß API Usage

### Payment Creation API

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/payments/create-session`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "paymentProvider": "WISE",
  "bookingType": "class",
  "itemId": "class-123",
  "userId": "user-456",
  "customAmount": 100.00,
  "wiseRecipientDetails": {
    "name": "Dance Instructor",
    "email": "instructor@example.com",
    "currency": "USD",
    "type": "EMAIL"
  }
}
```

**Response** (Wise):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "paymentProvider": "WISE",
  "transferId": "12345",
  "quoteId": "67890",
  "status": "processing",
  "estimatedDelivery": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "fees": 2.50,
  "rate": 1.25,
  "booking": {
    "id": "booking-123",
    "confirmationCode": "CLASS-1234567890-ABC",
    "totalAmount": 100.00,
    "finalAmount": 100.00
  }
}
```

### Webhook Handler

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/webhooks/wise`

The webhook automatically:
- Validates the signature
- Updates transaction status
- Updates booking status
- Sends confirmation emails
- Triggers notifications

## üîÑ Payment Flow

### Wise Payment Flow

1. **User selects Wise**: User chooses Wise as payment method
2. **Create quote**: System creates a Wise quote for the payment
3. **Create recipient**: System creates or uses existing recipient account
4. **Create transfer**: System creates a Wise transfer
5. **Fund transfer**: User funds the transfer (via Wise platform)
6. **Status updates**: Webhooks provide real-time status updates
7. **Confirmation**: User receives confirmation email when payment succeeds

### Status Mapping

| Wise Status | Internal Status | Booking Status | Description |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| `incoming_payment_waiting` | `CREATED` | `PENDING` | Waiting for payment |
| `processing` | `CREATED` | `PENDING` | Payment being processed |
| `funds_converted` | `SUCCEEDED` | `CONFIRMED` | Funds converted successfully |
| `outgoing_payment_sent` | `SUCCEEDED` | `CONFIRMED` | Payment sent to recipient |
| `bounced_back` | `FAILED` | `CANCELLED` | Payment bounced back |
| `charged_back` | `FAILED` | `CANCELLED` | Payment charged back |
| `cancelled` | `CANCELLED` | `CANCELLED` | Transfer cancelled |

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Testing with Sandbox

1. Use the sandbox API URL: `https://api.sandbox.transferwise.tech`
2. Use sandbox credentials from your Wise business account
3. Test webhooks using tools like ngrok for local development:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   # Then use: https://your-id.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/wise
   ```

### Configuration Validation

The system includes built-in configuration validation:

```typescript
import { validateWiseConfig } from '@/app/lib/wise'

const validation = validateWiseConfig()
if (!validation.isValid) {
  console.error('Wise configuration errors:', validation.errors)
}
```

## üîí Security
