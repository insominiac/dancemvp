## 🎯 Completed Tasks

### ✅ 1. Admin API Endpoints
Created comprehensive admin endpoints for monitoring partner matching:

- **`/api/admin/partner-matching/profiles`** - View all user profiles with filters
- **`/api/admin/partner-matching/requests`** - Monitor all match requests  
- **`/api/admin/partner-matching/matches`** - View successful matches
- **`/api/admin/partner-matching/stats`** - Comprehensive statistics and analytics

### ✅ 2. Admin Dashboard Component
**`/app/admin/sections/PartnerMatchingManagement.tsx`**
- 📊 **Statistics Overview**: Total profiles, requests, matches, success rates
- 👥 **Profile Management**: View all user profiles with search and filtering
- 💌 **Request Monitoring**: Track all match requests and their status
- 💕 **Match Tracking**: Monitor active partnerships
- 📈 **Analytics**: Experience level, location, and dance style distributions

### ✅ 3. Role-Based Access Control

#### For Students/Users and Instructors:

#### For Admins:

### ✅ 4. Security Implementation
